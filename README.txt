The AM NMI Gateway for WooCommerce enables secure and efficient credit card payments via the NMI gateway.

== Description ==

AM NMI Gateway for WooCommerce is the ultimate solution for WooCommerce stores looking to provide secure, reliable, and fast credit card payment processing. The plugin integrates seamlessly with the NMI (Network Merchants, Inc.) payment gateway, offering merchants a powerful solution for handling online transactions. Whether you run a small store or a large e-commerce site, this plugin ensures your customers enjoy a smooth and secure checkout experience.

== Use of 3rd Party Service ==

This plugin relies on the **NMI (Network Merchants, Inc.)** payment gateway to process credit card transactions. When you use this plugin, your store's payment data is securely transmitted to NMI via a POST request to the NMI API endpoint, and a response indicating the success or failure of the transaction is returned.

=== Details: ===

- The plugin sends payment data (such as credit card information and billing details) to the NMI API at `https://secure.nmi.com/api/transact.php`.
- The API processes the data and returns a response indicating whether the transaction was successful or not.

Please ensure that your use of this plugin complies with any applicable legal requirements in your region for transmitting data to a third party.
